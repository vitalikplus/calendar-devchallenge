Try it here [link to view the app](https://vitalikplus.github.io/calendar-devchallenge/ "calendar for devchallenge app")
This is the calendar app.  

#### The possible improvements: 
1. Offline cart (saving the state in the localStorage)
2. Test coverage, inputs validation, error handlings 
3. Track how many product items are left on storage. Do not add the finished product. 
4. Use the components styled by material, bootstrap look.
5. Anything else?
