Try it here [link to view the app](https://vitalikplus.github.io/calendar-devchallenge/ "calendar for devchallenge.it app")
This is the simple calendar app. The google calendar was the prototype for it. 
The library [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/ "moment.js library") is used to manipulate dates. 
MVC pattern is set. 
Separate thanks to jQuery for its help.  

#### The main features 
1. Works Offline saving the state in localStorage
2. Week view layout (events are not positioned by start-end time yet) .
3. Add events with the start and finish dates and time and text note.
4. Edit and delete events. 
5. Navigate by weeks (prev|next)  

#### The possible improvements: 
1. Weekly view. Position events by start-end time.  
2. Month and year view layouts. 
3. Show events, which last longer than one day.
4. Full day events and less than full day events separation.  
5. Test coverage, inputs validation, error handlings 
6. Use the components styled by material, bootstrap look.
7. Anything else?
